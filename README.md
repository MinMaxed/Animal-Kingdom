# Animal-Kingdom

## Description
This is a lab to test Object Oriented Principles and Interfaces in the framework of the Animal Kingdom/Zoo. It goes three levels deep of inheritance and classes, with 2 interfaces that are attached to classes on different tiers of abstractness.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are a workaround to C#'s single-inheritance, and tells the class what it is able to do. I have 2 interfaces, ICanFly and ICanSwim. They are utalized in all three major branches, Ducks using both, GreyWolves using Swim, Fish having the Swim Interface, and Bats using Fly as well.
