## Interfaces
As far as I can tell, Interfaces are a collection of possible attributes that describe things that a class can do. I was under the impression that Interfaces are a workaround for C#'s lack of multiple inheritance, but now it appears that they should not be used on abstract classes, but on the concrete levels. So I thought that you could impliment a 'ICanSwim' interface on the abstract canine, but now I think that you have to do it on the conrete GreyWolves.
